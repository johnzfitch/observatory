  "limitations": [
    "Intended scope: artistic images only",
    "NOT a deepfake photo detector",
    "Training excludes Midjourney 5, SDXL, DALLE-3",
    "General computer imagery (webcams, screenshots) may confuse detector",
    "Trained on older generation models (pre-2023)",
    "Images scoring 90%+ AI probability should be reviewed by human expert"
